## Visualizing Data with Leaflet

This project visualizes an earthquake data set.

Data source : (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) 
(From here I picked the data for all earthquakes in the last day.) 


Here I create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from last days data set based on their longitude and latitude.

The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

Additionally popups provide information about where the earthquake happened, what the depth and the magnitude was. 

You can open the page on live server. To do that

1. Clone the repo on your computer
1. Open index.html with live server

Now click on the markers to get more information about each earthquake.
